So 11:59am is one minute before 12:00pm.
As soon as the clock switches from 11:59am to 12:00pm, it becomes 12:00pm or noon.

The key is that 11:59am is still morning, while 12:00pm is midday.
The transition happens right as the clock ticks over to 12:00pm.

Is 12:00pm the minute that follows 11:59am?
When 11:59am changes to the next minute, does it become 12:00pm?
Does noon immediately follow 11:59 in the morning?
So 11:59am leads right into 12:00pm, yeah?
When it's 11:59 in the morning, the next minute it'll be 12pm, right?
