Hey, would you be able to rewrite this story in the style of a diary entry, 
the way a native English speaker might write it?

Is it possible for you to redo this passage as a diary-style narrative 
that sounds natural for a native English speaker?

Could you please rephrase this story as if it's an excerpt from a dairy, 
using language a nativee English speaker would use?

I'd appreciate if you could rework this in the informal tone of a personal diary, 
similar to how a native English speaking person would write conversationally.

The contracted phrase "I'd" is used a lot in English. 
It can mean both "I would" and "I had", correct?
How can I tell from the context whether "I'd" means "I would" or "I had"?

You're absolutely right. In English, 
the contraction "I'd" can stand for either "I would" or "I had" depending on the context.
Determining which one it represents requires looking at how it's used in the sentence.
Here are some tips:

If "I'd" is followed by a verb, it usually means "I would"
Ex: "I'd love to join you for dinner." (I would love to...)

If "I'd" is followed by a past participle verb, it usually means "I had"
Ex: "I'd finished my homework before going out." (I had finished...)

If you can substitute "I would" in the sentence and it makes sense, it means "I would"
Ex: "I'd prefer not to drive home so late" (I would prefer not to)

If you can substitute "I had" and it makes sense, it means "I had"
Ex: "I'd eaten already when they called to go to dinner" (I had eaten already)


So in summary, look at the surrounding words and see if swapping "I would" and "I had"
fits logically. 
Let me know if this helps explain how to determine which meaning "I'd" is conveying.
Practicing identifying when it means "would" vs "had" is great experience!
