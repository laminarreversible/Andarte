This morning after I woke up, my mom told me that my brother would be coming by later to pick up some of his belongings.
He moved out of the house a while ago and has been renting his own place.

The phrase "a while ago" is a vague expression referring to an unspecified but significant amount of time in the past.

My brother came by and gathered some of his belongings from his old bedroom.
He also asked my mom if he could borrow some money. He said he needed about $5000, 
so my mom gave him the money.
She told him that he could reach out anytime if he needs any other help in the future.
After getting his things and the money, my brother left to head back home to his own house.

Some key changes:
a)
Used "came by" instead of just "took" to convey he visited.
b)
Said "from his old bedroom" for clarity.
c)
"Asked if he could borrow" rather than "told he needs" sounds more polite.
d)
Specified the amount as "$5000" for clarity
e)
Changed "mom gave him the money" to be more active.
f)
Used "reach out" instead of "tell her" for the offer of future help.
g)
Rearranged word order in some sentences to flow better in English.

Please let me know if this rephrasing makes the sequence of events clearer and more natural sounding!

Sure, let me provide a more detailed explanation of that sentence:
"My brother left to head back home to his own house."

This means:
a)
"My brother" refers to the speaker's male sibling.
b)
"Left" means he departed or went away from the current location (his mother's house in this case)
c)
"To head back" indicates he was going to return to another location he considers "home" (his own house)
d)
"Home" here refers to his own personal residence, rather than his childhood home with his parents.
e)
"To his own house" further specifies that the home he is heading back to is the house he lives in currently,
that he owns or rents himself.
f)
The use of "own" emphasizes it is his personal house, not his parent's anymore.

Good question! Let me provide a detailed explanation of the phrase "found my breakdown":

In this context, "my breakdown" refers to the thorough, 
step-by-step explanation I provided in my previous response, 
where I broke down the meaning and implications of the sentence phrase-by-phrase

a)
"My" indicates it was the explanation given by me, the speaker.
b)
"Breakdown" means a detailed analysis that breaks something complex down into simpler, bite-sized parts.
c)
When I said "Knowing that you found my breakdown awesome...", it means you felt the systematic explanation I provided was excellent and helpful for understading.
d)
"Breaking down" a sentence means looking at it closely, clause-by-clause, and elucidating what each individual component means and adds to the overall meaning.
