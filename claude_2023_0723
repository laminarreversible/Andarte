This morning my mom said she wanted to drink some tea and asked if I could get her a bubble tea. I suggested that instead of buying bubble tea, we could just make tea using the tea bags we have at home. I explained that bubble tea is expensive and I'm concerned about the hygiene of those shops. I offered her some tea bags we had, including black tea and green tea flavors, that she could use to brew herself a fresh cup of tea here.

a)
Used "said she wanted" instead of "asked me that she wants" to be more concise.
b)
Specified she asked me to "get her" a bubble tea, rather than the vague "buy some".
c)
Changed "I told her" to "I suggested" which sounds more polite when declining a request.
d)
Explained my reasoning more clearly (expense, hygiene concerns).
e)
Offered the tea bags as an alternative to buying bubble tea.
f)
Used "brew herself a fresh cup" rather than just "drink the tea by tea bag"

Let me know if this rephrasing sounds more natural and conveys the conversation flow well!
