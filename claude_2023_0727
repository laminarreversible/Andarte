This morning when I went to the street market, I came across a concerning situation.
There was group of people gathered around one stall, and someone was talking animatedly to them.
As I walked closer to listen in, I realized the person was spreading misinformation and trying to deceive the crowd.
He was relaying fake news to the other people standing there. After listening for about three minutes, I stepped in and interrupted him. 
I tried to politely correct what he was saying by explaining the real truth about the situation, based on the factual information I knew.

* Used "concerning situation" to characterize what was observed
* Said he was talking "animatedly" which implies persuasively.
* Specified he was "spreading misinformation" and "fake news".
* Changed "tried to correct" to "tried to politely correct" to convey tone.
* stated "the real truth" and "factual information" for emphasis.
* Rearranged word order in some sentences for clarity.

a)
Excuse me, I noticed you were using the prefix 'over' a lot. What is the opposite prefix to 'over' that has the reverse meaning?
b)
Sorry to interrupt, but you used the prefix 'over' a lot. Is there an opposing prefix that means the reverse of 'over'?
c)
Pardon me, I heard you using the prefix 'over' repeatedly. WHat's the prefix with the opposite meaning to 'over'?

So the prefix 'under' is the opposite to the prefix 'over', is it right?

* Starting with "so" makes it sound conversational, like you are confirming something just discussed.
* Putting the key prefixes "under and "over"  in quotes helps isolate them.
* "Is the opposite to" is a clear, natural way to indicate a contrasting relationship.
* Ending with "is it right?" invites confirmation in a casual tone.
* The grammar follows normal structure and rules.
* The vocabulary is simple and common.

a)
Okay, I want to make sure I have this right-'under' is the opposing prefix to 'over', correct?
b)
Just to clarify, 'under' would be the reverse prefix of 'over', yeah?
c)
So if 'over' means one thing, then 'under' signals the flipside - am I understanding that properly?

That's a great question! When looking at words that use the prefix "over-" like "overflow" and "overcooked",
the opposite prefix that expresses the reverse or lack of "over" would be "under-".

Here are some examples:

Overflow vs Underflow

* Overflow means to spill over, fill too much.
* Underflow means to be too little, not fill enough

Overcooked vs Undercooked

* Overcooked means cooked too long, too thorougly
* Undercooked means not cooked long enough, insufficiently

Overestimate vs Underestimate

* Overestimate is to judge as larger or greater than actual
* Underestimate is judge as smaller or less than actual
