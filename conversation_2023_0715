After I left the store, I popped into a restaurant real quick and got lunch to-go for me and my mom.
I ordered a chicken meal for myself and pork for my mom. I made sure to tell the staff itwas both to-go.

I ordered two meals - a chicken meal for myself and a pork meal for my mom.
For my chicken meal, I asked the staff if they could make it bigger - with more meat, more sides, and more rice.
They told me it would cost an extra $10 to size it up. I said "No problem, let's do it."

After waiting about 10 minutes, I grabbed the to-go bags with our meals. I hopped in my car and drove home.

Great question! Let me clarify what I meant by "popped into a restaurant."
In this context, "popped into a restaurant" means I briefly went inside the restaurant to order takeout food,
rather than waiting outside or going through a drive-thru window.

To rephrase with more details:

I parked my car and went into a small restaurant near the grocery store.
I walked up to the counter and ordered two lunch meals to go - one for me and one for my mom.
After about 10 minutes, the staff gave me the bag with the packaged meals.
Then I headed out, grabbed the food from the counter, and drove home with our lunches.

So "popped into" means I went inside briefly rather than using a drive-thru window or waiting in my car.
